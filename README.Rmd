The goal of NiceNums is to provide information about the numbers between 0 and 2000. Some numbers are better than others and this package helps you find out which are which.

## Installation


This package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by calling:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bkmackay/NiceNums")
```
## Examples

The package is simple to use, if you want to find out if 876 is a nice number simply use the `what_if` function:

```{r example}
library(NiceNums)
what_is(876)
```

How about 1960?

```{r }
what_is(1960)
```

As you can see, there is an amazing number for you to find! There is also a secondary function hidden in the package files which tells you what the best number is. Your task will be to update the documentation and roxygenise the function so it appears in the package.
